**Unit 4: Cells and Cell Membranes** <span id="4"></span> 
*Cells are the smallest unit of life.  This unit will help you to
understand the characteristics, components, and functions of a cell.  By
learning the structures of the cells, you can see the similarities and
differences between organisms.  Bacteria, plant, animal, and fungus
cells are similar in many ways and contain many of the same small
structures known as organelles.  However, there are characteristics that
can help you distinguish whether a cell belongs to an animal, plant,
fungus, or bacteria.  For example, all plant cells contain cell walls,
while animal cells lack this particular organelle.  It is the water
within a cell pressing against the cell wall that gives a plant its
rigidity and your celery its crunch!*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 17 hours to complete.

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Describe and diagram the structure and function of a typical
    biological membrane.
-   Describe characteristics of a membrane, solutes, and solvents, as
    well as predict where molecules will move and how the mass of a cell
    may change.
-   Describe characteristics of a cell, and classify the cell as a
    prokaryotic, animal, or plant.
-   Identify organelles that are found in typical prokaryotic, plant,
    and animal cells.
-   In simplified terms, explain how caffeine inhibits the adenosine
    signal pathway.
-   Indicate the functions of the various cellular organelles including
    the nucleus, cell membrane, cell wall, mitochondria, chloroplasts,
    ribosomes, Golgi body, central vacuole, rough endoplasmic reticulum,
    smooth endoplasmic reticulum, lysosome, and peroxisome.
-   Explain how large signal molecules get their signal into the cell.
-   Describe the forms of transport across biological membranes.

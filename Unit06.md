**Unit 6: Photosynthesis** <span id="6"></span> 
*Have you ever wondered how a plant grows from a tiny acorn to a giant
oak?  Where does all that biomass come from?  How does it get the energy
to grow?  This unit will help you answer those questions by discussing
photosynthesis.  Photosynthesis is the fascinating process by which
plants convert light energy to chemical energy.  Because plants are at
the bottom of the food pyramid in almost all ecological systems,
understanding how they grow and develop will give you a greater
understanding of your environment.*

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 7.5 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 6.1: 3 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 6.2: 0.25 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 6.3: 0.25 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 6.4: 2.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 6.5: 1.5 hours

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Explain the role of photosynthesis.
-   Describe where matter originates and ends up during photosynthesis.
-   Explain how photosynthesis converts low-energy molecules into
    energy-rich carbohydrates.
-   Explain how energy is transformed and transferred during
    photosynthesis.
-   Explain how energy is stored in plants.
-   Explain how plants accumulate biomass.
-   Explain the role of the light-dependent phase of photosynthesis.
-   Explain the role of the light-independent phase of photosynthesis,
    and describe how it is related to the light-dependent reactions.
-   Explain what is meant by the term “carbon cycle” and how this
    relates to the conservation of matter.
-   Explain how plants have adapted to deal with the problem of
    photorespiration.

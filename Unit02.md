**Unit 2: Basic Chemistry** <span id="2"></span> 
*Life is driven by chemical processes.  Many topics in chemistry overlap
with basic biology principles.  To fully understand biology, you must
have a basic understanding and appreciation of chemistry.  The readings
and lectures presented below can help you prepare for the topics in the
course as well serve as a resource to which you can refer throughout the
semester.  This unit contains a series of YouTube video lectures that
will address basic chemistry topics.  You may find that the importance
and organization of this unit will make more sense as you proceed
through the course.*

**Unit 3: Biological Molecules** <span id="3"></span> 
*All organisms contain the organic biological molecules—carbohydrates,
proteins, lipids, and nucleic acid—that are essential to life.  Having
an understanding of the structures and functions of these molecules will
help you understand what organic molecules our body needs to function
properly. *

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   List the characteristics of water that make it important to life as
    we know it.
-   Explain the characteristics that are necessary to make something
    alive.
-   Recognize the structure of the four major biological macromolecules.

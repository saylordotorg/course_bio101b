title: "BIO101B: Introduction to Molecular and Cellular Biology"
course_description: "A detailed introduction to molecular biology, including proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids, water, and other compounds that make up the cell. Particular emphasis is placed on the cell membrane, mitosis and meiosis, genetics and gene expression, transcription and translation, and cellular metabolism."

**Unit 9: Mendelian Genetics & Chromosomes** <span id="9"></span> 
*Do you ever wonder why you look so similar to your brother, or where
you got your freckles from?  Are you concerned about developing a
disease that another family member struggles with?  These are the types
of questions that can be answered with an understanding of genetics.
 This unit will teach you about the basic principles of inheritance and
will help you understand the chances of a trait being passed from one
generation to another.*

**Unit 9 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 8 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 9.1: 2.25 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 9.2: 0.25 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 9.3: 2.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 9.5: 3 hours

**Unit9 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Explain how information flows, at the molecular level, from genotype
    to phenotype.
-   Define mutation and explain how mutations can result in an altered
    phenotype.
-   Given information about parents’ genotypes or phenotypes, provide
    expected probabilities for offspring genotypes and phenotypes.
-   Define and apply the following terms: genotype, phenotype,
    homozygous, heterozygous, dominant, recessive, co-dominant, and
    sex-linkage.
-   Given a pedigree, infer whether the trait in the diagram is dominant
    or recessive, and indicate individual genotypes when possible.
-   Solve genetic problems involving monohybrid crosses with dominant
    and recessive traits, codominant traits, and sex-linked traits.
-   Solve genetic problems involving dihybrid crosses with dominant and
    recessive traits, codominant traits, and sex-linked traits.
-   Explain how a mutation, such as that in sickle cell, can result in a
    changed phenotype.
-   Explain how natural selection can maintain traits like sickle cell
    that seem detrimental.
-   Given a pedigree, infer whether the trait in the diagram is dominant
    or recessive.
-   Given a medical or social situation related to genetics, apply
    genetic principles to both sides of the issue (e.g., “should the
    NCAA require sickle cell testing?” or “should two people with sickle
    cell trait have children?”)

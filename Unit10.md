**Unit 10: Gene Expression** <span id="10"></span> 
*In this unit, you will learn about the universal genetic codes
deoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid, which are better known as
DNA and RNA.  DNA and RNA are universal because one or both are found in
every known organism!  As you learned in Unit 7, the DNA and RNA in
every organism are made up of the same few “ingredients.”  However, the
slight differences are what account for the differences between species
(what makes a dog different from a toadstool) and the differences within
species (what makes you different from your neighbor).  This unit will
give you a greater understanding of the genetic code and its impact on
your life.*

Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Explain the molecular basis of heritable traits. In other words,
    explain how information in DNA is ultimately expressed as a protein.

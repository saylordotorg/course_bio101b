**Unit 8: Cellular Reproduction: Meiosis** <span id="8"></span> 
*Meiosis is a specialized type of cellular reproduction that only occurs
in the ovaries and testes and results in an egg or sperm, respectively. 
Sexual reproduction is responsible for the amazing amount of diversity
within a species.  When sperm fertilizes an egg, the resulting offspring
contain genes from the father and the mother.  In essence, you contain,
at least in a small part, genes from ALL of your ancestors.*

**Unit 5: Enzymes, Metabolism, Cellular Respiration** <span
id="5"></span> 
*The cell uses enzymes and metabolic pathways to conduct the chemical
reactions within the body.  The sum total of every chemical reaction in
your body is known as your “metabolism.”  Understanding the reactions
that comprise your metabolism is essential to understanding how your
body acquires and uses energy to survive.*

**Unit5 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Describe the role of enzymes and how they perform this function.
-   Recognize and explain the difference between matter and energy.
-   Explain the role of cellular respiration.
-   Account for the matter inputs and outputs to glycolysis, the
    preparatory reaction (pyruvate oxidation), the tricarboxylic acid
    cycle, and the electron transport system.
-   Describe the source and fate of energy in glycolysis, the
    preparatory reaction (pyruvate oxidation), the tricarboxylic acid
    cycle, and the electron transport system.
-   Apply the laws of thermodynamics and conservation of matter to
    metabolism.

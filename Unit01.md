    (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: Watch the entire lecture.  Note that at the 30-minute
    mark, the lecturer misspeaks and says that “thymus enlarges.”  The
    thymus is a small organ in the upper chest involved in the immune
    system. The lecturer meant to say “thyroid” when referring to a
    goiter in the neck.  Note that the last portion of the lecture
    (properties of water) applies to subunit 3.1 below.  This video
    should take you approximately 47 minutes to complete.

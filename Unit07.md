**Unit 7: Cellular Reproduction: Mitosis** <span id="7"></span> 
*This unit discusses the process of cellular division known as mitosis.
 Mitosis happens in almost every cell of your body and is responsible
for growth as well as the replacement of damaged cells.  Serious
consequences, such as cancer, can occur if this cell cycle is disrupted
in some way.  The topics you will study in this unit are essential in
understanding basic principles about your health.*

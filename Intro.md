Welcome to BIO101B, Introduction to Molecular and Cellular Biology. 
This course is intended for the student interested in understanding and
appreciating common biological topics in the study of the smallest units
within biology: molecules and cells. Molecular and cellular biology is a
dynamic field.  There are thousands of opportunities within the medical,
pharmaceutical, agricultural, and industrial fields (just to name a few)
for a person with a concentrated knowledge of molecular and cellular
processes.  This course will give you a general introduction of these
topics.  In addition to preparing for a diversity of career paths, an
understanding of molecular and cell biology will help you make sound
decisions in your everyday life that can positively impact your diet and
health. Note that this course is an alternative to
[BIO101A](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio101a/), and that you may
choose to take either BIO101A or BIO101B in order to learn about
Molecular and Cellular Biology.  These courses cover the same material,
but in a slightly different way. **This course provides students the
opportunity to earn actual college credit. It has been reviewed and
recommended for 3 credit hours by [The American Council on
Education](http://www.acenet.edu/Pages/default.aspx) (ACE). While credit
is not guaranteed at all schools, we
have [partnered](http://www.saylor.org/partner-schools/) with a number
of schools who have expressed their willingness to accept transfer of
credits earned through Saylor. You can read more about our ACE
program [here](http://www.saylor.org/student-credit-pathways/ace/).**

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able

### Course Information

Welcome to BIO101B.  Below, please find general information on this
course and its requirements. 

**Course Designer**: [Ann
Schlosser](http://www.saylor.org/faculty-o-t/#ProfessorAnnSchlosser);
the course materials were originally arranged by faculty from the
Washington State Board for Community and Technical Colleges.

**Primary Resources**: This course is comprised of a range of different
free, online  
 materials.  However, the course makes primary use of the following
materials:

-   Khan Academy [Video
    Lectures](http://www.khanacademy.org/video/elements-and-atoms?playlist=Chemistry)
-   YouTube: University of California, Berkeley: Jennifer Doudna’s
    [Video
    Lectures](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o35W00DTPM&feature=youtu.be&t=11m)
-   Michael J. Farabee’s *[Online Biology
    Book](http://www.emc.maricopa.edu/faculty/farabee/biobk/BioBookTOC.html)*
-   Carnegie Mellon’s [Open
    Learning *Initiative*](https://oli.web.cmu.edu/jcourse/webui/portal.do)

Please note that the Carnegie Mellon resource requires that you signup
to create a login and password for free to access the open course
initiative.

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will have to review the material from all units (1-10).  Pay special
attention to Units 1 and 2, as these lay the groundwork for
understanding the more advanced, exploratory material presented in the
latter units. You will also be required to complete:

-   Subunit 1.3 Problem Based Learning Assessment
-   Subunit 4.3 Problem Based Learning Assessment
-   Subunit 5.4 Problem Based Learning Assessment
-   Subunit 6.4 Problem Based Learning Assessment
-   Subunit 9.3 Problem Based Learning Assessment
-   Subunit 9.4 Laboratory Assignment
-   Subunit 10.6 Laboratory Assignment
-   The Final Exam

 The following laboratory assignments are optional  

-   Subunit 1.4 Laboratory Assignment
-   Subunit 2.3 Laboratory Assignment
-   Subunit 3.4 Laboratory Assignment
-   Subunit 4.4 Laboratory Assignment
-   Subunit 5.5 Laboratory Assignment
-   Subunit 6.5 Laboratory Assignment
-   Subunit 7.4 Laboratory Assignment
-   Subunit 8.3 Laboratory Assignment

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam.
 However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the required assignments listed above.  It is optional, but
recommended, that you also complete the traditional laboratory
assignments listed above.

In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the Final Exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.

**Time Commitment**: This course should take you a total of **102
hours** (approximately 81 hours of resources and 21 hours dedicated to
laboratories) to complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that
lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.
These should help you plan your time accordingly. It may be useful to
take a look at these time advisories and to determine how much time you
have over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set
goals for yourself. For example, Unit 1 should take you about 8.5 hours.
Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and decide to complete
subunits 1.1 and 1.2 (a total of 3 hours) on Monday night; subunit 1.3
(a total of 2.5 hours) on Tuesday night; subunit 1.4 (a total of 3
hours) on Wednesday night; etc.

**Tips/Suggestions:** For more information on the topics covered in this
course, please refer to [BIO101A](../../courses/bio101a/).  As you read
or watch the lectures, it may be helpful to take notes.  It has been
found that the physical act of writing helps a student retain material.
 These notes can also act as a study guide for the Final Exam.
